# Hi, I’m Gabriel Huber

I’m 18 (born 2007), a full-stack web developer and graphic designer focused on **PHP, Laravel, and native JavaScript**, with working experience in **React, Next.js, and Express.js**.

## About my work

Much of my experience comes from private or collaborative projects that can’t be open-sourced, either out of respect for client ownership or because they no longer reflect how I work today. I’m selective about what I publish here and aim to share work that represents my current thinking and standards.

## Skills

- **PHP** — 6+ years  
- **Vanilla JavaScript & browser APIs** — 6+ years  
- **MySQL / MariaDB** — 6+ years  
- **Laravel** — 4 years  

Additional experience with **Python** (3 years), **React, Next.js** (2–3 years), and **Express.js** (~3 months exp., was asked to learn for a project, picked up quickly through a strong JS/backend foundation).
